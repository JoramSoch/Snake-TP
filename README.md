# Snake-TP

<h3>A Snake clone in Turbo Pascal, just written for nostalgic reasons</h3>

Two years ago, I was refreshing my Pascal coding powers and for this purpose, I wrote a clone of the Snake computer game. Here, I'm uploading the code with English comments (`SNAKE_EN.PAS`) and German comments (`SNAKE_DE.PAS`). This is mainly for educational purposes, I would guess. Snake-TP was developed using Turbo Pascal 7.0 running in DOSBox 0.74.
